/*
Write a function called caughtSpeeding.

You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded
as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed
is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your
birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.
*/

console.log(caughtSpeeding(65, false)); // → 1
console.log(caughtSpeeding(65, true)); // → 0

//2 parameters, one indicating the speed you were going, the second indicating if it is your birthday or not
// return will be a 0,1, or 2
// if speed <= 60 will return 0 unless bday then <= 65
// if speed >= 61 && <= 80 will return a 1 unless bday then >= 66 && <= 85
// if speed is >= 81 will return a 2 unless bday then >= 86

//fin

//someone online said you can do it this way but i dont understand it bc of the multiple comparison operators...
